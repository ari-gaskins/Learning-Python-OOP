# data types are parts of a class 
# functions are part of classes as well 
# data type classes are made to give certain objects certain behaviors
# example: string, int, float, functions, etc.

x = 10
hello = 'hello'

print(type(x))
print(type(hello))

# methods are functions that are inside of a class
# methods are parts of classes which manipulate the behaviors of objects of certain data types
# example:
string = 'hello'

# the '.upper()' portion is the method of the class string
print(string.upper())
